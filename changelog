    *4.0-1:
    upstream releases:
      videosort-4.0:
	- improved detection of obfuscated file and directory names;
	- added support for DNZB-Headers "X-DNZB-ProperName", "X-DNZB-EpisodeName",
	  "X-DNZB-MovieYear";
	- removed support for DNZB-Header "X-DNZB-UseNZBName";
	- new option "DNZBHeaders" to disable using of DNZB-Headers if necessary;
	- new format specifier "%imdb" and "%cpimdb" (thanks Chris Hamilton for the patch);
	- removing invalid characters from generated file name;
	- updated guessit-library to the newest release - this fixes several issues.

      videosort-3.0:
	- added for seasoned TV shows: if year in the file name goes directly after
	  show name, it will be added to show name. This may be necessary for
	  media players like XBMC, Boxee or Plex (or anyone using TheTVDB) to
	  properly index TV show. New option option "SeriesYear";
	- added detection of obfuscated file names; if such file name is detected
	  a nzb-name is used instead.
	
      videosort-2.0:
	- new options "TvCategories", "OtherTvDir" and "OtherTvFormat" for TV shows, whose file names look like movies (neither series nor dated shows);
	- new format specifier "{TEXT}" to make text lowercase;
	- new format specifiers "%y", "%decade", "%0decade" for seasoned TV shows;
	- added support for multi episode file names (example: My.Show.S01E02-03.mkv);
	- new option "EpisodeSeparator" to adjust formatting of multi episode file names;
	- added support for DNZB-Header "X-DNZB-UseNZBName";
	- added printing info-message when skipping small files;
	- added using of command "[NZB] FINALDIR" to inform NZBGet about new files location; this path is then shown in the history dialog as "Destination";
	- destination directories (options "MoviesDir", etc.) can be left empty to use global "DestDir" or "CategoryX.DestDir"  as destination;
	- updated guessit-library to the newest release - this fixes several issues.

      videosort-1.0:
	- initial release.
